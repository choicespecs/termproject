                            Previously, we have shown how results can affect and help students throughout their learning process.
                            Our group has worked towards creating an interface that can assist students in gathering this information especially
                            in hybrid online synchronous classrooms.

                            Feedback for instructors is crucial is maintaining a balanced "pace" in their classroom. This will bridge the gap 
                            for instructors to help maintain this "pace" for all students. This interface will help students non-intrusively give feedback to teachers in online synchronous classrooms.

                            Addressing levels of complexity can address the issues with current solutions involving addressing both feedback and engagement.

                                    Our team’s mission is to develop an efficient solution for pedagogical issues that face both teachers and students.
                                    The
                                    solution we offer is an application that affords to not only serve as a platform for communication between students
                                    and
                                    teachers, but also gives students and teachers plenty of tools and feedback to increase success on both ends.
                                    Through
                                    integration of layered functions, our goal is to offer the best learning experience for students, teachers and
                                    business
                                    professionals. We aim to improve classroom focus, increase learning retention and enhance virtual classrooms. Given
                                    our
                                    design, the proposed research question is as follows: How can we measure knowledge retention and overall immersion
                                    of a
                                    TeamWorkWork user?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In order for us to correctly answer the proposed research question there are several factors to consider. One factor
                                    to
                                    consider are the stakeholders involved. Our design aims to satisfy the needs of students, faculty and business
                                    professionals. By defining the end user, we can directly adjust various metrics or features accordingly. Another
                                    factor
                                    to consider are the methodologies our team aims to include for testing. Given the context of our question as it
                                    applies
                                    to the end users we can create several testing methods for evaluation. Our team decided on observation/participant
                                    observation, surveys, experiments and secondary data analysis for testing methodologies to help answer our proposed
                                    research question.

                            </h3>
                            <div class="body">
                                <p>Before implementing a testing procedure it is imperative to gain informed consent from the experimental groups. We have
                                several ways of achieving informed consent with our stakeholders such as feedback request emails, surveys such as the
                                one we provided in milestone 2, and pop up notifications built into the application which indicates to users that
                                feedback and diagnostics will be collected unless they wish to opt out. Our survey asks several questions such as: “How
                                much did you enjoy using TeamWorkWork?”, “Would you say that TeamWorkWork improved your engagement with your
                                audience/presenter?”, “How likely are you to recommend TeamWorkWork to your peers?”, and “In what ways could
                                TeamWorkWork improve your experience with the app (optional)?” Providing a numerical scale for qualitative questions
                                like those in the survey, allows us to numericise user responses and effectively answer our proposed research question.
                                We know that users who score high on enjoyment and answer yes to improved engagement prove the success of our design.</p>
                                <p>Collecting feedback and diagnostics for our software, unless users choose to opt out, allows us to extrapolate and
                                expand our design further. Data such as average time spent on the application, most used functions, and answer accuracy
                                are vital for quality control. This data is also important to our proposed research question from a statistical
                                perspective. We can gauge immersiveness through average time spent on the program, and measure knowledge retention
                                through gradebooks which are also available to teachers. Teachers can also utilize the gradebook as a means of
                                developing curriculum or compare it with in person scores. As many of the solutions we provide currently exist in
                                various educational websites or softwares, secondary data analysis may provide benefit to the design. Applying the same
                                research question to websites such as kahoot then analyzing available data from kahoots API such as quiz accuracy or
                                quiz participation will allow us to develop a more enriching educational tool. Since our testing procedures will be
                                conducted completely online, it will comply with social distancing guidelines and be safe enough even in times like a
                                pandemic.</p>
