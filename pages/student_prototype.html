        <h3>User Story</h3>
        <p>How might we as students accomplish accessing quiz question results so that we can prepare for topics the class finds
        difficult for tests.</p>
        <div style="margin:0 auto; max-width: 1000px;">
            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p> It's important for students to access and have information such as their quiz results to get better feedback to improve their learning within the classroom. However; it is important not to overwhelm students with too much information and give them "meaningful" feedback that may lead them to further their learning. Too much information can lead students to either misunderstand the information provided or becomes too preoccupied with irrelevant statistic or numbers that may not be important for either their grades or their learning. </p>
            <p>Our prototype and design focuses on allowing students to have the option to get both a simple general overview of their grades and information within class, as well as provide the opportunity to gather more specific details on their results. This works in line with our other user-story which addresses levels of complexity by allowing students in the same way to allow them levels of complexity in terms of their quiz and grade results. All students will have the opportunity to get general information which may assist them in understanding where they may need to focus on in terms of learning within the class. However; if students choose so, they can also receive more detailed information which may help them focus specifically on an area that they may need additional help on. We have also added a feature to include class statistics so students can understand how they may place with their peers in the class as well.</p>
