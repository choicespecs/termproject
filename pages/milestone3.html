                            <p> As a group, we worked together to try and come up with several different user stories to try and see if we could find some user stories that could connect with our proposed solution. We came up with several different user stories that did focus on these areas of improving feedback and engagement, but only three specifc user stories truly connected with us and became bigger areas we wanted to focus on because they connected a bit better to our proposed solution. We also chose these specific user stories because they gave us a more narrowed scope on a specific area we could target in terms of improving feedback and engagement. </p>

                                Feedback for instructors is a very important part of any classroom. However, hybrid synchronous classrooms face issues from obtaining meaningful feedback from students. This can be due to the lack of interactions available between the teacher and the students in an online classroom. Typically, teachers in face to face classrooms might be able to read many different signs of feedback that students may be having issues with content in the classroom. For example, students might physically show their discomfort in the classroom, students may be more vocal in their immediate response to questions on content, or instructors may have a better intutiton surrounding the class in a physical face to face environment over an online one. One key component that seems to be highly important for improving the classroom and obtaining meaningful feedback is maintaining interactions between students and teachers. Research done by Anthony Francescucci and Laila Rohani on comparing online synchronous classrooms with face to face courses addresses how important interactions are by comparing asynchronous online classrooms with synchronous online classrooms "asynchronous online learning lacks interactions between students and instructors. Therefore,synchronous interactions positively improve students’ engagement enabling instructors to provide feedback and to interact with students instantly" <a style="text-decoration: none"
                                    href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0273475318818864">(<i>Exclusively Synchronous Online (VIRI) Learning: The Impact on Student Performance and Engagement Outcomes</i>)</a>
                                    If online synchronous classrooms can get closer to mimicing more meaningful feedback similar to face to face classrooms by allowing a way students can have more interactions with the teacher, this can be a improvement for everyone in the classroom. Some of the benefits can be an improvement of teaching and learning by adjusting the "pace" of the course specifically by reviewing content or continuing onto more difficult content as necessary. This pace of instruction may be hard to maintain for many teachers without even explicit direction from students, so obtaining a way to have students directly address "slow down" for instructors can help improve the pace of instructor and learning as well.

                                Ann Poulos and Mary Jane Mohony's <i>Effectiveness of feedback: the students’ perspective</i>, addresses how important
                                feedback is for students and how it can affect many areas of student's experiences and learning. "effectiveness of feedback extends beyond types of delivery and timeliness, that feedback contributes to successful transition to university for students in the first year, and that credibility and hence impact of feedback is influenced by student perceptions of the provider. The importance of ensuring feedback is congruent with student expectations, and that student expectations are congruent with good learning practices" <a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02602930601127869">(<i>Effectiveness of feedback: the students’ perspective</i>)</a>
                                Many research has been performed on delivering effective feedback for students. A lot of the research has focused more on face to face classrooms addressing factors such as delivery, timeliness, and different forms of feedback that may be more or less effective for instructors to help improve students learning. However; online synchronous classrooms are quite different overall from face to face classrooms and possibly require a different method or approach to understanding and delivering effective feedback. The one positive benefit to online classrooms are their ability to utilize different software, applications, and third party websites to improve analysis on student's results and activities on content in the classroom. However; some of these results do not translate exactly to effective feedback for the student's themselves. It's important then to translate this information of analysis to forms of feedback that can be effective for the student's learning.

                            <p style="padding:0; margin:0;">
                                Ben Shneiderman’s paper, <i>Promoting universal usability with multi-layer interface design</i> addresses this idea of a multi-layer interface design which can be beneficial to all. The purpose of this multi-layer interface is meant to cover this idea of pace according to needs, "designs would enable users to remain an expert at layer 1, or to push ahead to higher layers. Even expert users might appreciate lower layers since frequent operations might be accomplished with fewer steps. Of course online help facilities will have to be tuned to multi-layer designs, so that the training manual for layer 1 is brief and comprehensible even to anxious novices" <a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://dl-acm-org.proxy-remote.galib.uga.edu/doi/10.1145/960201.957206">(<i>Promoting universal usability with multi-layer interface design</i>)</a> Current solutions that seem to address the issues in synchronous online classrooms of improving feedback and engagement all have this issue of different levels of complexity. Some solutions can be too simple for some instructors while others seem to be way too complex for their needs. The ability for instructors to be able to adjust the layer within an interface can help address this issue and can make the possible solution more complex or more simple according to the instructors needs or even their knowledge level of technology. Some instructors may not be too familiar with technology or many interfaces itself and may only desire a simple drag and drop interface. However; some more well-versed instructors may want a more complex interface even including aspects to code to create their own activities or feedback within the classroom. There are too many instructors, students, and classrooms to generalize one specific complexity that can address them all, so allowing instructors to adjust these multi-layer interface can create a very flexible tool that can be used for all situations depending on the instructor themselves.
