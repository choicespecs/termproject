                <p>Presentations are tried and trusted vehicle in transmitting information. These can be seen commonly in education,
                business, and social contexts. With the advent of online video conferencing and powerpoint, presentations are shifting
                towards, boring, unengaging mediums. An <a href="https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/harvard-just-discovered-that-powerpoint-is-worse-than-useless.html">article from INC</a> contains the
                quote "PowerPoint was rated (by online audiences) as no better than verbal presentations with no visual aids. (Ouch.)"
                <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/universities-should-ban-powerpoint-it-makes-students-stupid-and-professors-boring-2015-6">BusinessInsider</a>
                confirms this stipulation. Presentations are no longer the main event of engaging symposiums, but the dreaded part that
                loses people’s interest and engagement. Issues are presented such as a distinct lack of realtime feedback and assessment
                of knowledge from the audience, which causes for information to be lost in transit from presenter to user, wasting
                valuable time and resources to get people to understand. There is a need for an enhancement of the current presentation
                format: the audience needs to be engaged, and the presenter needs realtime feedback and discovery so that the message
                being presented is transmitted effectively.</p>

                    Students - much of education is not only from instructor to
                    student, but from peer to peer; students deserve to have a
                    vehicle to impart their knowledge on their companions that
                    grants them the benefits of engagement and feedback

                    halls, students can be found sleeping, distracted, and
                    daydreaming. To ensure that we are effectively educating the
                    younger generations for the future, it is clear that we have
                    to present better

                    heard that a meeting could’ve been an email? Presenters are
                    fighting an uphill battle in trying to capture the minds of

                  A few ways instructors have tried to combat the issues of
                  feedback and engagement within the hybrid synchronous
                  classroom has been through solutions like online tools,
                  websites, or applications such as Top Hat and Kahoot. Another
                  alternative solution has been utilizing options and tools
                  located within online classrooms like Zoom such as
                  whiteboards, polls, and breakout rooms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Alternative websites and applications like Top Hat and Kahoot
                  add more engagement in classrooms by providing active learning
                  activities that can be utilized by both online students and
                  in-class students. These activities and websites provide
                  quizzes, polls, and other activities which can engage students
                  in real time, and can also provide a bit of feedback. They
                  help both teachers and students understand the “pace” of the
                  learning within the classroom through carefully selected
                  questions or activities. One problem that arises with these
                  materials is that they typically require students to use their
                  phones to access these applications while they are within the
                  online classroom at the same time. This can be potentially
                  problematic considering that some students may use their
                  phones to connect to their classrooms and could lead to
                  potential technical issues when students are using their
                  phones to both connect to the classroom and access these
                  applications together. Another problem with using these
                  websites and applications is also the complexity or lack of
                  complexity of these applications. The potential uses of both
                  Kahoot and Top Hat require a bit of creativity, experience,
                  and knowledge on behalf of the instructor to use within their
                  classroom. Therefore, it does require a bit of training,
                  practice, and first-hand experience to understand how these
                  tools can be applied within a classroom. This can create a
                  wide spectrum of issues that are not consistent for all
                  instructors. Sometimes these applications can be too complex
                  for instructors to use and sometimes they can be too simple
                  because they lack specific feedback and have limited options
                  in activities for teachers to use for their classrooms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By having all of the options and tools inside one platform,
                  online classrooms like Zoom can help combat the potential
                  technical problems of students having to access different
                  technologies by having them altogether in one place. However;
                  this does face the same challenges as using alternative
                  websites and applications like Top Hat and Kahoot. These tools
                  and options that are inside online classrooms like Zoom can be
                  somewhat worse compared to alternative websites and
                  applications mainly because they are more limited in the
                  amount of activities they can provide students and the
                  feedback is even more general or is not provided at all to
                  both students and instructors. Therefore, Instructors will
                  need even more training, experience, and creativity to
                  understand how to utilize these options and tools for their
                  classroom.

                  We can use Ben Shneiderman’s paper, Promoting universal
                  usability with multi-layer interface design, as a solution to
                  our issue. Shneiderman’s paper talks about a universal
                  usability/design that would satisfy both first-time users as
                  well as intermittent and expert users. The design is using a
                  multi-layer interface design that enables novice users to
                  begin with a limited set of features at the first layer of the
                  design. They can remain at layer 1, then move up to higher
                  layers when needed or when they have time to learn further
                  features.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This would be a viable solution to our existing solution
                  because we would allow users to use one platform that would
                  layer each option/tool such as Kahoot, Zoom, TopHat, etc. The
                  advantage of layering these features would make the learning
                  curve of having one platform that contains all these features
                  much easier. Just like when you take an exam you wouldn’t want
                  to cram all the information at once, you would want to space
                  out the information so that you would learn over time, and
                  this feature would do just that.

                  They offer guidelines for design of user interface software in
                  six functional areas: data entry, data display, sequence
                  control, user guidance, data transmission, and data
                  protection. The areas we would be studying particularly would
                  be sequence control and user guidance, as implementing
                  Schneiderman’s interface design would focus on them. Sequence
                  control for the movement of each layer and user guidance in
                  making sure that the platform is easy to follow, and
                  progressively gets more complex.

                  We would like to design an application that affords to not
                  only serve as a platform for communication like lectures
                  between students and teachers, but also gives students and
                  teachers plenty of tools and feedback to increase success on
                  both ends. Our application would build on previous solutions
                  by integrating tools such as whiteboards, quiz and poll
                  capabilities, and breakout rooms all in one app for teachers
                  to take advantage of to address engagement, but would have
                  additional functionalities to remedy our targeted problem of

                  and engagement to both teachers and students, as well as to
                  automatically generate feedback reports for each session and
                  save them for students and teachers to be able to access later
                  in preparation for assessments. The system would aim to
                  achieve user satisfaction on both ends and include appropriate
                  and intuitive signifiers to indicate user capabilities as its
                  interface would closely resemble interfaces our users are
                  already relatively familiar with after engaging with Hybrid
                  Synchronous learning technology during the pandemic.

                  We recognize that this system seems to endeavor to do a lot.
                  It is essentially an all-inclusive platform for Hybrid
                  Synchronous learning, but we believe having everything in one
                  application is the most convenient solution for our users. In
                  order to assist in universal usability, however, we would also
                  like to propose this system be implemented using
                  Schneiderman’s multi-layered interface design. Users will be
                  able to add and remove capabilities as they desire, making the
                  difficulty adjustable, so that even relatively technologically
                  illiterate users will be able to navigate effectively. We hope
                  that this will give our application a steep (fast) learning
                  curve and further solve difficulties in distance learning.

                  There are several factors to consider in order to measure the
                  success of the design. To begin, defining success requires a
                  broad understanding of the limitations the design intends to
                  improve on. Comparing functionality with existing solutions is
                  one way to determine design success. Specifically, utilizing
                  features presented in Zoom, TopHat, and Kahoot on the whole
                  will provide classroom clarity and enhanced standards for
                  learning. Certain metrics of value include: activity
                  completion rate, usability scale and feedback scoring, user
                  surveys. These metrics are useful to determine whether or not
                  goals are met and how efficiently the design allows users to
                  complete a task. Due to the complex nature of the design,
                  there are several factors to consider, such as: ease of use,
                  user satisfaction, student retention, instructional support,
                  etc. These factors will be considered throughout the design
                  process and aid in structured integration. Another important
                  measure of success revolves around client / customer
                  interaction. Feedback is a critical tool to enhance the
                  success of the design. Communication with stakeholders enables
                  better implementation and direct results.
